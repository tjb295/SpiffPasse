# SpiffPasse
Little Project to get accustomed to Angular and Firebase. A mock shopping site using Eric Erole's brand Spiff Passe as the subject.

#Technologies used
Angular, Firebase, Bootstrap, NPM, NodeJs.

#Status
Been a while since I contributed to this project, had plans to enter shipping information.
Removed MongoDB serving products since the server was running off my laptop and I have since disabled it. 
Products shown now static values. 

Also removed being served through a NodeJs server since it is now hosted on Northern Arizona University's DANA site.
